# Wow, what a website!

This is the repo of my personal website (you can access it through [www.er9.dev](www.er9.dev)), built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, my designs on Figma and some JS skills.

## Same old mistakes

I did not write any test in the codebase, and I will do it later. This is not what I do in production products, but, hey, take it easy.

## Next features

There is a list of future fixes and improvements I will make (probably in the next 2 weeks) to make this site as perfect as I thought it would be (and at least a little bit beautiful).  
The fixes (and features) are:

- [] Add tests to the codebase, boy
- [] Implement a functional navigation bar
- [] Details modal for every work experience
- [] Work experience pagination (yeah, I have worked a lot)
- [] Projects Section (I am involded in a lot of stuff, and you will know it)
- [] Education Section, because I have some certifications that I am proud of
- [] Responsive design (it will be easy to implement, but I need to think about some design aspects)

## Still here?

If you're still reading this README, why don't you check the website? :)
